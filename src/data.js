Commit, merge, push, pull, clone, init... the list goes on. I watched a tutorial on YouTube, but still didn't get the point of it. After this week, I fully get the point of it, why it matters, I see the ease of access and keeping everything organized.

This week our project was to recreate a Birdwatching website. I choose to do different colors and styling because I didn't enjoy the colors of the original, but I'm sure someone out there does! It was rewarding to finally have a project to put together and for it to actually come together. I plan on finding some cool things to do with CSS.

It was such a great feeling. We were pushed to the limits this week. There were two projects this week. A silly story generator and an alarm clock. The silly story generator was essentially a walkthrough project, but the alarm clock was from scratch. When I first started, I stared at a blank screen for at least thirty minutes wrapping my head around how I was even going to start this, let alone finish. I started breaking it down. I thought about the functionality of an actual alarm clock. What does it need? ...and that's where I started. I researched, took many notes, bits and pieces of information from different resources and put it all together. I'm not 100% satisfied with what I presented, but it worked and it was good enough for me now. I plan on revisitng this project as I progress.

                had a voice inside of me telling me that I was going to get out and make a successful life. In 2012, I started working at an Applebee's in Hazard, KY.
                Two years later I became a Manager and moved to Huntington, WV. This was a moment that changed my life and set the trajectory for the rest of my life.
                I worked for Applebee's until 2018 when I moved to Lexington, KY to take a position at J. Alexander's. I worked there for over three years and realized
                that I was wasting my time living a life that I still wasn't proud of. I was "successful" by the term of many people from back home, but I still didn't 
                feel like my success meant anything to me. I have always been interested in coding and the web. I'll never forget the "oo's and ahh's" from
                creating fabulous MySpace pages that others envied. I found out about Awesome Inc. while driving downtown so I went to their website and the rest 
                is history! I have no choice because I feel that my "Why" is now. I have been waiting my whole life for an opportunity to turn my life into something
                that I want it to be and for the first time, I took a leap of faith to escape and break the barrier that was built around me from the start. This is my time.`

                Pseudocoding helps you understand the problem at hand and how you're going to find a solution to the problem. You wouldn't build a house without a blueprint and on a smaller 
                scale, Pseudocode is the blueprint to your program. It's an informal way of writing the instructions to your programs procedures and functionality. There's no right or wrong

It's nice that having a general idea of one language can carry over into the next. Being paired with a partner for pair programming this week was great because we got to learn the language with someone else!"

                a1: "A major similarity between JS and Python is that most arithmetic operators work exactly the same. A lot of things are similar, but done with different wording. A major difference between JS and Python is the syntax and how they define code blocks. JS uses {} to group statements and Python uses indentation. Their naming conventions are different, as well, with JS using lower camel case and Python using snake case. Null vs None, Python contains float integers, Arrays vs Lists, the == operator in Python works like the === operator in JS, JS has Switches and Python doesn't."

I could see an advantage of starting with Python due to readability, but I still feel that it would be easier to switch from JS to Python than learning Python and switching to JS."
