        <h5 className="intro">
          This week we started learning Python for our back-end language. It was
          pair-programming all week so it was a nice change of pace compared to
          every other week. The project for this week was creating a RPG game
          'Evercraft' with a partner while ping-pong programming.

        <h2 className="questions">
          Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest
          hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the
          next biggest thing to power through?
        </h2>
        <h5 className="answers">
          The biggest hurdle that I have gone past is grasping the use of Classes.
          This week was eye-opening for the use of classes and why they're
          important. I think the next biggest thing to power through is going to
          be the final project.
        </h5>
  
        <h2 className="questions">
          Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your
          final project? Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed
          now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?
        </h2>
        <h5 className="answers">
          I was excited to hear about the 'Attack of the Clones' project that we
          will be able to carry on over as our final project. I am struggling with
          ideas of anything else that I may want to do.
        </h5>
  
        <h2 className="questions">
        What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript?
  
        </h2>
        <h5 className="answers">
        The first week in Python was definitely easier to grasp compared to the first week
         in Javascript. It's nice that having a general idea of one language can carry over 
         into the next. Being paired with a partner for pair programming this week was great 
         because we got to learn the language with someone else!
