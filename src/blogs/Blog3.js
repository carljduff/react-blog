        <h5 className="intro">This week was Javascript and at the very least, I'm happy to say that I got through it. 
        It was challenging, there were moments that I wanted to scream (or did scream), and there were also moments of success! 
        When the Javascript code that I wrote worked, I wanted to run around my house! It was such a great feeling. We were pushed 
        to the limits this week. There were two projects this week. A silly story generator and an alarm clock. The silly story generator 
        was essentially a walkthrough project, but the alarm clock was from scratch. When I first started, I stared at a blank screen for 
        at least thirty minutes wrapping my head around how I was even going to start this, let alone finish. I started breaking it down. 
        I thought about the functionality of an actual alarm clock. What does it need? ...and that's where I started. I researched, took 
        many notes, bits and pieces of information from different resources and put it all together. I'm not 100% satisfied with what I 
        presented, but it worked and it was good enough for me now. I plan on revisitng this project as I progress. I know it's only going 
        to get more challenging from here.

        <h2 className="questions">What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering 
        content and providing a user experience?
</h2>
        <h5 className="answers">I love the way everything works together to provide the user experience. HTML is the backbone, 
        CSS is the look, and Javascript is the act! Learning Javascript at a base level was rewarding. Each has such an important 
        role in the user experience.
