            <h5 className="intro">This week was all about API's and asynchronous functions. We went over Fetch, 
            Promises, JSON, Axios and I'm sure I'm leaving something else out. It was a lot to take in and I added 
            some topics to my back-log to gain a deeper understanding. The project for this week was building a Weather 
            API from scratch. I was impressed by how much I truly learned last week that led me into this week.

            <h2 className="questions">What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?
</h2>
            <h5 className="answers">This week was a very important week to me. It was my favorite week so far by how motivated, determined and proud I was. I learned how I learn
                best this week and I know it set up a whole new level in my understanding of how things work. I was very focus on Pseudocode this week and I learned
                that it's one of the most, if not the most, important things to focus on. Last week I did Pseudocode as well, but nothing like this week. 
                I just realized that the difference between my stress levels compared to this week and last could 
                simply come down to my Pseudocode.</h5>

            <h2 className="questions">What does it mean to develop good code?
</h2>
            <h5 className="answers">Developing good code means that it is easy to read and efficient. If someone 
            used the code after I wrote it, it should be wrote in a clear way and easy way of understanding so someone 
            else could also understand it and know what it's doing.

            <h2 className="questions">What does it mean to be a good developer?
</h2>
            <h5 className="answers">I think that being a good developer means finding a solution to the problem at hand, caring about what you're doing and using your knowledge,
                skill and ability to make a difference. We all can make a difference in such subtle ways and sometimes simply caring about what we're doing 
                and having a passion for this work really drives a developer into being a good or great developer.</h5>
