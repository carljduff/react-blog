        <h5 className="intro">This was the first week we broke away from Vanilla Javascript. At the beginning 
        of the week, the sense of dread was captivating about leaving the known for the unknown. After Tuesday, 
        diving into the docs for React and starting a walk-thru tutorial, I had a better understanding and had 
        a basic grasp. This was a week that I will remember because it has stood out to me the most. The difference 
        in how I felt at the beginning of the week compared to the end was astronomical. I saw concepts coming 
        together for one of the first times since in the Bootcamp. This weeks project was to build a Restaurant
         Menu and pull the menu data from an API. It was the first week we had a lot of control on how we styled 
         our application. This was one of my favorite weeks so far. So excited for next week to dive further into 
         React!

        <h2 className="questions">Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?

</h2>
        <h5 className="answers">I think that the React library so far has been on the easier side of using. 
        I really enjoyed the documentation of React. I think it's easy to understand the docs, easy to follow 
        along step-by-step and there was a walk-through tutorial that I also enjoyed.

        <h2 className="questions">What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?

</h2>
        <h5 className="answers">I'm very interested in learning more about Kaboom. It's a JavaScript game
         programming library that helps you make games fast and fun. I've always been into video games 
         and think it'd be awesome to make a simple one!

        <h5 className="answers">Electron allows you to build cross-platform desktop apps with Javascript, 
        HTML and CSS. No natvier development experience is required. It allows you to maintain one JavaScript
