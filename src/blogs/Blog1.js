            <h5 className="intro">I am so excited to finally get started. Before we started the bootcamp,
             we got a breakdown of what we'd be doing weekly. I started researching these 
             topics and I jumped into Git and Github a week before it started. I remember 
             thinking 'there's no way I'll ever get this'. Commit, merge, push, pull, clone, 
             init... the list goes on. I watched a tutorial on YouTube, but still didn't get 
             the point of it. After this week, I fully get the point of it, why it matters, 
             I see the ease of access and keeping everything organized. Also, those once haunting 
             words, now make sense and I know when to use them, and the purpose of their use. 
             This was a great week and I'm motivated for next!"</h5>

            <h2 className="questions">Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h2>
            <h5 className="answers">The first week of the bootcamp was a mix of what was expected and what wasn't. 
            I came in with the mindset that there was going to be no room for error. After the first few days, I now 
            feel comfortable that we're able to fail, not be judged and that it's part of the learning process. I enjoy 
            the learn, build, and measure model that's being presented. I feel that I have had an adequate amount of time 
            to learn the material, use the knowledge to build this blog and now I'm able to measure what I need to revisit 
            or continue learning in order to be successful."</h5>

            <h2 className="questions">What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h2>
            <h5 className="answers">I am excited to dig deeper into Web Development and lay a basic foundation of knowledge that 
            I can build upon. I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, but look forward to diving into 
            Javascript! I am eager to learn about the backend of development to understand how everything works behind the scene.</h5>

            <h2 className="questions">What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h2>
            <h5 className="answers">I have never written a blog before, nor have I realized that I would enjoy it as much before 
            starting this one. I look forward to updating it weekly so you can follow along with my journey. I've had four jobs 
            since I started working at 16. I was at my first job for two years, the second a year, the third eight years and my most 
            recent job going on four years. During this bootcamp will be the first time I've not worked since I've been 16.</h5>
